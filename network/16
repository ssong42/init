I found that I can redirect an ip address to another by opening the etc/hosts file and editing it.
Online it says to, enter the ip address of the desired server which is (10.51.1.253) for intra.42.fr
then leaving a single space then entering th ip address (46.19.122.85) that I want to point the original IP.
